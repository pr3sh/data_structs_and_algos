### **`Introduction`**: 

Data structures and aAlgorithms are fundamental concepts in Computer Science, which are used for the efficient storage and manipulation of data.
Data Structures specifically, refer to the organization, storage and retrival of data, while algorithms refer to the instructions that are utilized to solve a particular problem.

###### **`Hash Maps`**:


A Hashmap is a data structure used to store information and primarily consists of two main components; a *key* and *value*. For example, an employer might have a unique **`employeeID`**, which maps to each individual in the organization as shown below.

```python
employee_mapping = {
     "1000356" : {
                "full_name": "John Doe",
                "postion"  : "Software Developer"
                 }      ,
     "1017890" : {
                "full_name": "Sofia Cummings",
                "position" : "Program Director"
                }   
    }
```
